Welcome to the Task Management System, a project management tool designed to help teams organize and manage their tasks efficiently. The system is built on a RESTful API using the Flask framework and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern.

The system consists of several classes that work together to provide a comprehensive task management solution. These classes include Project, Priorities, Sprint, Task, Task Status, and Users.

The Project class represents a collection of related tasks and is used to group tasks together by a common goal. The Priorities class allows users to prioritize tasks based on their importance. The Sprint class is used to organize tasks within a specific time frame, typically two weeks, and is useful for Agile project management methodologies.

The Task class represents a single task within a project and includes attributes such as task description, due date, priority, and status. The Task Status class provides an overview of the current status of each task and is used to track progress towards completion.

Finally, the Users class represents individual users of the system and is used for user authentication and access control.
The system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for each class, and users can interact with the system through HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These requests can be used to retrieve, add, update, or delete data from the system.

In summary, the Task Management System provides a robust project management solution for teams looking to manage their tasks efficiently. With its RESTful API, MVC architecture, and support for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, the system offers a flexible and powerful solution for managing projects of all sizes.
